### About

Beautifully designed by our expert team. Once we had an idea for what we wanted the app to be, we initially used Figma to draft up some ideas for the project.

Here are some of the initial drafts:

In the end, we only decided to base the font for the site of this design in Figma, as well as some of the layout/spiel.

We may use Figma briefly again for the next project, but I'm not sure if it'll be useful to use it as extensively as we did for this project.

Also, there was some confusion about how the 'landing page' would look. It was decided that you'd only be able to see images of the plants on the 'home/main' page once you had signed up/logged in.

This meant that the 'landing page' would only display things such as the logo, as well as links to log in or sign up.

### The Process

We built upon a lot of the code we had used in the previous weeks â€“ particularly for the database and authentication projects/workshops.

We split up into teams and tried to swap partners regularly, with a rough schedule of working together for 55 minutes, taking a 5 minute break, and then reconvening and swapping partners.

In terms of the code, we set up a typical file architecture structure based off Oli's example:


We created a function that adds a plant to the database using 'map'. This was based on Craig's group's code last week for their 'Grinder' skateboarding app:
